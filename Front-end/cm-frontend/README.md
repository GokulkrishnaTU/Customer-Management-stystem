To install Customer-Management-system project from a GitHub repository, assuming the project's database is MongoDB Atlas, you'll typically follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub Repository:

git clone <repository_url>


Set Up MongoDB Atlas:
If the project is configured to use MongoDB Atlas, you'll need to create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cluster. Follow the instructions provided by MongoDB Atlas to create a cluster and obtain the connection URI.

Configure Environment Variables:
Check if the project has any environment variables that need to be configured. Usually, database connection strings and sensitive information are stored in environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables. For example:

makefile
Copy code

MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas Connection URI>
Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install dependencies for both the server and client.

bash
Copy code
cd <project_directory>


npm install       # Install server dependencies
cd client
npm install       # Install client dependencies
Start the Development Server:
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server. Typically, you'll have separate commands for starting the server and the client.

bash
Copy code
# Start server backend (from the root directory of the project)
node index.js

# Start client frontent (from the client directory)
npm start
Access the Application:
Once the server and client are running, you can access the MERN stack application by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (assuming the default port is 3000).

Additional Configuration:
Depending on the project's requirements, you might need to perform additional configuration tasks, such as setting up authentication, configuring routes, etc. Refer to the project's documentation or README file for more information.

Remember to follow any specific instructions provided in the project's README or documentation for installation and setup.
